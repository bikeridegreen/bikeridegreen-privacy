  <h1>Bike Ride Green – Privacy & Safety Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: October 1, 2025</em></p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Bike Ride Green (“the App”) is designed with privacy and safety in mind.  
  Unlike many other fitness or cycling apps, <strong>Bike Ride Green does not track, profile, or share your personal data</strong>.  
  Your information remains under your control at all times.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII).  
  The App does <strong>not</strong> require an account, does <strong>not</strong> use analytics, and does <strong>not</strong> send your data to external servers or third parties.</p>

  <h2>3. Ride Data</h2>
  <p>Ride data (such as distance, speed, elevation, calories, and intensity) is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>.  
  It is never uploaded, shared, or transmitted without your explicit choice.  
  You may delete ride data at any time by removing the App or clearing your history within the App.</p>

  <h2>4. Location Access</h2>
  <p>The App requires access to your location to track rides and display routes on the map.  
  Location data is used <strong>only while recording a ride</strong>.  
  If you enable background access, it will be used solely to record your ride accurately.  
  Location data is <strong>never shared or transmitted</strong> outside your device.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App does not integrate advertising, tracking, or third-party analytics tools.  
  All calculations (such as calories, speed, and intensity) are performed locally on your device.</p>

  <h2>6. Safety Guidelines</h2>
  <p>While Bike Ride Green helps track your cycling performance, <strong>your safety always comes first</strong>.  
  - Always keep your attention on the road.  
  - Do not interact with the App while riding.  
  - Use a safe mount if you display live stats.  
  - Obey traffic laws and signals.  
  - Respect pedestrians and fellow road users.  
  The App is a tool to assist your cycling experience, but you are responsible for safe riding at all times.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App does not knowingly collect data from children under 13.  
  Parents or guardians should supervise use of the App by minors.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes</h2>
  <p>This Privacy & Safety Policy may be updated in the future if features change.  
  Any updates will be published at the same URL.</p>
